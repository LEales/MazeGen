# MazeGen
Mazegen is a Java-based maze game that uses JavaFX and Maven. In this game, players navigate through a series of increasingly challenging mazes, each specifically designed for that level. The objective of the game is to reach the end of each maze as quickly as possible while avoiding obstacles and dead ends. With each level, the difficulty increases, making the game progressively more challenging and engaging.
